# Solar Energy Market Analysis

## USC ITP249 Data Analytics Project
By Me and my project partner Jackson Cong

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Google Project Sunroof data to provide insights for solar roof installations across different regions in the United States. For Part 1, we use Tableau for data visualization and analysis of the data.

## Visualizations

Our analysis includes:

1. **Interactive Geographic Map** - Regional and state-level visualization of solar suitability
2. **Solar-to-Carbon Offset Ratio** - Bar chart comparing states' capacity to reduce carbon emissions
3. **Market Potential Scatter Plot** - Clustering analysis of installation ratios vs. yearly sunlight
4. **Radar Chart** - Comparison of sunlight potential across different roof orientations by region

## Technologies Used

- **Tableau** (v2023.1.2)
- **Data Processing Techniques**: 
  - Data cleansing and harmonization
  - Pivot/Unpivot transformations
  - Calculated fields
  - Parameter actions for interactive filtering
  - Geographic mapping with drill-down functionality
  - Clustering analysis

## Data Sources

All provided in CSV files that can be found here:
- [Google Project Sunroof data (June 2023)](https://sunroof.withgoogle.com/data-explorer/)
- [Google Project Sunroof metadata](https://storage.googleapis.com/project-sunroof/csv/latest/metadata.csv)
- [USA States to Region lookup table](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/omer2040/usa-states-to-region)

## Project Highlights

### Interactive Dashboard
Our main dashboard features a comprehensive view of solar potential across the United States with interactive filters allowing users to explore specific regions and states. The USC-branded dashboard includes:

- Color-coded maps showing solar suitability percentage
- Key metrics display for selected regions
- Comparative analysis across states and regions

## How to View This Project

1. Install Tableau Desktop or Tableau Reader (2023.1.2 or newer)
2. Open the `.twbx` file and link your downloaded data
3. Interact with the dashboard to explore different regions and states
